# DAILY WORK


- First thing: in my brain i have this matrix table

|theme|criticality|Time spend(estimate)|value|Personal value|
|-----|------|----------------------|-----|--------------|
|what i need to act?| 1-5| 1h - 2weeks| 1-10| 1-10|

**Theme:**
This section has the problem, project, incident, change and other things.

**criticality:**
1 - See and act (sometimes is ticket from my manager/director, its bad, but pay my salary :/)
2 - Problem in production
3 - Problem in other environments
4 - Projects
5 - Calls, doubts and other things

**Time Spend(estimate)**
in my mind all tasks can be done in:
- (2) 5 minutes
- 1 hour
- 4 hours
- 1 day
- 3 days
- 1 week
- 1 month
- 3 months
- 1 year
**Disclaimer:** It`s not work time, but time to delivery, so something i can do in 4 hours, but its not critical, so go to the end in queue. I fill in last.

**Value**
How much money does this bring to the bussines? 
Stay alert. know your bussines, process, burocracy, because sometimesthis bring reduce costs but has more process and you have a task wich bring extra time to the team (better deploy, for example)

**Personal Value**
How this task make me better. Yes, padwan, some tasks are great for experience (create a ws account with control tower and terraform), deploy istio in my k8s. so, try ti find some positive thing in all tasks 


After, my queue be done and know i start to work with this tips. None of that i created, but make part of my day. You can find more expensive content in google.

- 2 minutes rule: if a task can be done in less than 2 or 5 minutes. Do it. DO NOT PUT IN QUEUE. DO IT, Things.DoItKnow() . This process prevent a lot of minitasks (things like, reeschedule a call, send a simple awnser in teams)
- Think before act: Take some time to tink in this task (20 seconds). this process can evicted that you take some action which is not critical (1)
- Pomodoro is your friend. Work 25 minutes and take 5 minutes break. Make this process know and thank`s me later.
- The Pareto rule: 20% of your effort gives you 80% of your result. Remember the think before act? Prioritize great goals, great works to maximize your productivity and effectiveness.
- Break each task in steps. Complete one part of the task at a time. This helps you to change between tasks, for criticit and reducing procrastination.
- Do hard talk at te morning when you have bad news or need help. Make 1:1's at the final of the day. This makes your colegue think in the subject.
- Delegate taks: Create a **NOT-TODO-LIST** eliminating taks wich you can not act, but get the status (create some rule in jira, change some firewall rule). Put this taks in Pending e create a alert for you, get answers about the tasks.

*The most inportant*

**DO NOT WORK IN MULTTASKS** YOU ARE NOT GOLANG, SO MAKE ONE ITEN EACH TIME. 
Multitasks can reduce your productivity and increase stress.
